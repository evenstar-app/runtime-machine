# runtime-machine

the idea is: for example in the future every blockchain is ok
-> just store data on the cheapest chain

so base on this I think I can build something like runtime engine on contract for all the EVM.
-> then just base on which one is cheapest then we will use it

so I have build some demo and deploy on:
https://testnet.snowtrace.io/tx/0xe90275a535cd41dc9c33172e6b97a439e0d36de547e6a3cee437632826f1f0c7

But I'm a bit lost and don't know what to build next
